The gist:
I have a vision for an art project. 
Interactive behaviour of clicking, fills, pixel study, and event listeners.


index.html
home base

on-off.html 
click the div box to activate fill command
key points:
*getelementbyID
*flexbox centering
*if/else to command fill order




ideas
link to similar or otherwise connect projects. inspiration, technique, whatever
other artist partnerships

glide in top and bottom menu. 

different css files for different projects
as well as the menu bar/footer
... wait. Cant this be done is JS?
have HEADER and FOOTER as singular elements in the main page, and then append that element to the body elsewhere on OTHER PAGES??? Call the same CSS over too?
